I am a little nervous, just as nervus as before in the classes of experiment at school. 
I read and understand the guidance, and guess what I have to do, then I doubt whether I have done it right or not as the guidance said, 
it seemed that I was always unsure what I had done is qualified, I was so unconfident and self-doubted. It was not pleasurable at all and 
that made me feel impatient with anything else with my major and afraid of being unqualified, I was tired and upset. 
However, now I get a sense of achievement, I know everything needs time and patience to cultivate, to practice, to better. And what I need 
to do is enjoying and playing.
